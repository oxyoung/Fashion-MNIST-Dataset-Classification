# Project-1-AI-for-Mechatronics-MCEN90048-
## Introduction
This repository is about the first project **Let us be a Fashion Critic** of AI for Mechatronics (MCEN90048).
The finished tasks are as follow:
1. Train and test a classification model based on Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)
2. Monitor the training process by utilizing tensorboard.
3. Profile the training process by collecting runtime statistics.
4. Randomly Visualize 400 images from the dataset in TensorBoard using t-SNE and PCA.
